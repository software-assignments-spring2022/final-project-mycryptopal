# Team norms

- Try your best to schedule time appropriately to attend meetings. Most meetings will be done through our team discord channel at a designated time that all team members are aware of in advance. 
- If you cannot attend a meeting for whatever the reason may be, you must explicitly inform every team member through either the iMessage group chat or the Discord channel. Informing one specific team member is not adequate, everyone should know why you cannot attend the meeting. Accommodations will be made accordingly. 
- If you have any issues or require help for whatever the task may be, please inform the team through the aforementioned communication channels to ensure problems are resolved. 
- If any team member is not following the rules laid out in this document, appropriate action will be taken and the professor will be notified. The professor will move forward with the best course of action. 

# Team values


- Communication is the most important aspect of our team dynamic
- If a member needs help with a particular task, bring it up in our group channels.
- If a conflict arises or a disagreement occurs, the group will compromise and move forward with the decision voted in democratically. 
- A group vote will occur in situations of disagreements, if we cannot come to a consensus unanimously, we will inform the professor and he can provide insight. 
- If a team member is failing to do his/her tasks, a warning will be given and if it still occurs, the professor will be notified. 
- Team members are expected to respond to messages as soon as possible, or will inform the other group members if a conflict arises.

# Daily standups

- We will try to meet after class for 15 minutes to talk about the three main questions of a sprint standup 
- members expected to be present synchronously or asynchronously in a predetermined manner.
- agreement that members will not cover for other members who do not participate.
- agreement that a member who makes no progress on a task for two standups or more in a row will be reported to management.

# Coding standards

- Designate a code editor and code linter all team members will use to standardize code formatting. 
- Don't over-engineer. Write minimum code to get things working end to end, only then iterate to improve.
  - Code for each task and spike must be peer-reviewed and pass tests before merging into the `main` branch of code.
- Always push working code, if you break the pipeline/build then fix it.
- Make granular and small commits, per feature or per bug fix.
- Provide descriptive commit messages.
- Write self documenting code. Use descriptive variable and function names. Avoid unnecessary name shortening.
- Don't leave dead/commented out code behind. If you see such code, delete it.
- Write automated tests to cover critical integration points and functionality (once you learn how to do that).

# Git Workflow

We are going to use a centralized workflow wherein everyone does work on their own separate time and can push to the central repository on their own branches. This way everyone can work asynchronously and still keep up to date with what is happening/what is being pushed and pulled.

# Instructions for Setting Up Local Development Environments

Will keep updated as dependencies and software requirements change. As of right now, all that is needed is the MERN stack. 

# Concluding thoughts

We plan on being honest and transparent with each other so that we can accomplish our stated goal: developing a full stack crypto web application
