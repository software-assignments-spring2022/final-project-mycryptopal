            {content: 1, contentText: "A basic concept to note about the difference between the crypto market and stock market is that owning stock means ownership of a piece of a company. In a public offering for example, selling shares allows a company to raise more money. In some cases, even after a company is publicly traded, it may issue more stocks to raise money, but this dilutes the value of current shares. \n On the other hand, cryptocurrencies are not backed by underlying assets or earnings. There are thousands of cryptocurrencies to choose from, and each of them are decentralized.This creates volatility as they are not regulated. In some cases, countries such as China have banned crypto in hopes of keeping a regulated finance system. \n Both are valid forms of investment that serve different purposes. In the following lessons, you will learn the fundamentals of crypto and how you can invest in your first cryptocurrency!"},
            {content: 2, contentText: "A blockchain is a distributed database that is shared among a computer network. This decentralized database is known as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Essentially, a blockchain records information that makes it very hard for someone to change, hack, or steal. \n A blockchain collects information in groups (called blocks), where each block has a certain  storage capacity. Different types of information can be stored on a blockchain, but the most common use is a ledger for transactions. Each transaction is recorded with a cryptographic signature called a hash. As such, if one block is changed (a transaction is made), it would be clear to see from the block history. \n Some important properties of Distributed Ledger Technology are: \n Programmable (smart contracts - will be covered in a later lesson) \n Secure (all records are encrypted) \n Anonymous \n Unanimous (all participants in a certain network approve each of the records) \n Time-stamped (recorded on a block) \n Immutable \n Distributed (all participants have a record of the ledger) "},
            {content: 3, contentText: "A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is not backed by institutions and secured by cryptography. It is a form of digital asset based on a network that is distributed across a large number of computers. Specifically, cryptocurrencies run on a distributed public ledger (blockchain) that records all transactions for participants of a network to view. This means it is extremely hard to counterfeit or double-spend. Some benefits of a system like this are cheaper and faster money transfers and decentralization. \n To note: Owning a cryptocurrency does not mean owning the coin. As an owner of cryptocurrency, you do not own anything tangible. Instead, you own a key that allows you to move a record from one person to another without having to go through an institution such as a bank."},
            {content: 4, contentText: "A cryptocurrency exchange is a digital marketplace where you can buy and trade crypto. You cannot buy crypto from a bank or investing firm. Thus, once you decide on a cryptocurrency you would like to buy, you must create an account on a cryptocurrency exchange where you will exchange U.S. dollars for digital assets. On crypto exchanges, in addition to buying and selling, you have the option to convert one cryptocurrency for another. For example, if you have bitcoin and would like to convert a portion of your bitcoin to ethereum, this can be done on the exchange. \n Some popular exchanges are Coinbase, Robinhood, and Binance. In order to choose the best crypto exchange, here are some things to keep note of: fees and minimum."},
            {content: 5, contentText: "There are two ways to store a cryptocurrency: hot and cold wallets. A hot wallet is connected to the internet and allows for faster transactions. However, they can be more vulnerable to hacks. A cold wallet on the other hand is not connected to the internet which minimizes the risks of a hack but causes inconvenience. Many people prefer hot wallets over cold wallets because of its convenience. For example, if you would like to transfer crypto to a friend and you use a hot wallet, you could transfer it online. However, if you use a cold wallet, you would need a device to plug in your USB and then transfer. That said, in terms of convenience, a hot wallet is the best option. But in terms of security, a cold wallet is favored. \n Some examples of hot wallets are Coinbase, Metamask, and Binance. An example of a cold wallet is a USB. \n To note: People who hold large amounts of crypto tend to use cold wallets to prevent scams and hacks. "},
